# Repledge Details Section Update

## Overview
The RepledgeDetails component has been refactored to fetch data directly from the `repledges` table (similar to the Customers section) instead of using a complex RPC function. This provides a cleaner, more maintainable implementation with better data relationships.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Hook: `useRepledgeDetails.ts`
**Location**: `src/hooks/useRepledgeDetails.ts`

This hook replaces the complex `useRepledgeDataDetails` hook with a simpler, more straightforward approach:

**Features**:
- Fetches directly from `repledges` table with nested relationships
- Automatically includes related data:
  - `loans` (with customer data)
  - `banks` (bank information)
  - `close_repledges` (closure records)
- Client-side filtering and pagination (like Customers section)
- Supports:
  - Text search (customer name, loan number, repledge number)
  - Status filtering (All, Active, Closed)
  - Bank filtering
  - Date range filtering (custom and predefined)
- Branch-aware (respects branch_id filtering)

### 2. Data Structure
```typescript
RepledgeDetailWithCustomer {
  id: string;
  loan_id: string;
  repledge_no: string;
  date: string;
  amount: number;
  interest_rate: number;
  validity_months: number;
  status: string;
  bank_id: string;
  branch_id: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;

  // Nested relationships
  customer: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    mobile_no: string;
    photo_url: string;
  };
  loan: {
    id: string;
    loan_no: string;
    customer_id: string;
    amount: number;
    date: string;
  };
  bank: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
  close_repledges: Array<{
    id: string;
    end_date: string;
    payment_method: string;
    calculation_method: string;
    duration: number;
    final_interest_rate: number;
    calculated_interest: number;
    total_payable: number;
    created_at: string;
  }>;
}
```

### 3. Updated Component: `RepledgeDetails.tsx`
**Location**: `src/screens/RePledges/RepledgeDetails/RepledgeDetails.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Now uses the new `useRepledgeDetails` hook
- Added Status filter option
- Added Predefined date range filters (Today, This Week, This Month, This Year)
- Improved filter UI with better organization
- Updated table to display data from nested relationships
- Simplified pagination using standard pagination controls
- Updated export functionality to use new data structure

**Filter Options**:
- **Search**: Customer name, loan number, repledge number
- **Status**: All, Active, Closed
- **Bank**: Dropdown of available banks
- **Date Range**:
  - Predefined: All Time, Today, This Week, This Month, This Year
  - Custom: Date picker for range selection

### 4. Key Improvements

**Before** (using RPC function):
```
useRepledgeDataDetails hook → RPC function → Database
```

**After** (direct table query):
```
useRepledgeDetails hook → Direct Supabase query → Database
Client-side filtering and pagination
```

**Advantages**:
1. Simpler code - no complex RPC function needed
2. Easier to debug - standard Supabase query patterns
3. Better performance - filtering happens client-side for 10 items per page
4. More consistent - matches the Customers section implementation
5. More flexible - easier to add custom filtering
6. Better data relationships - nested queries are cleaner
7. Branch-aware - automatically respects branch filtering

### 5. Pagination
- 10 items per page (ITEMS_PER_PAGE constant)
- Previous/Next buttons
- Page indicator showing current page / total pages
- Only shows when more than 1 page exists

## Database Schema Expected
The implementation expects:
- `repledges` table with fields:
  - id, loan_id, repledge_no, date, amount, interest_rate, validity_months
  - status, bank_id, branch_id, created_at, updated_at

- Relationships:
  - `repledges.loan_id` → `loans.id`
  - `loans.customer_id` → `customers.id`
  - `repledges.bank_id` → `banks.id`
  - `close_repledges.repledge_id` → `repledges.id` (optional)

## Usage
The component is automatically used when navigating to the Repledge Details view. No changes needed from the user perspective - all filtering and pagination happens automatically.

## Migration from Old Implementation
If you were using the old RPC-based approach:
1. The old `useRepledgeDataDetails` hook can still exist but is no longer used
2. The new hook handles all the same filtering
3. Data is returned in a different structure, but the component handles it

## Future Enhancements
1. Add export to multiple formats (CSV, PDF)
2. Add inline editing capabilities
3. Add bulk operations (status change, delete)
4. Add advanced search with multiple criteria
5. Add sorting by different columns
